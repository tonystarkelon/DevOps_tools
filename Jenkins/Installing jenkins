# Update the Debian apt repositories, install OpenJDK 21, and check the installation using the following commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-21-jre
java -version

# If the installation was successful, you should see an output similar to the following:

openjdk 21.0.8 2025-07-15
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.8+9-Debian-1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.8+9-Debian-1, mixed mode, sharing)

Long Term Support release
A LTS (Long-Term Support) release is chosen every 12 weeks from the stream of regular releases as the stable release for that time period. It can be installed from the debian-stable apt repository.
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2026.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins


Start Jenkins
You can enable the Jenkins service to start at boot with the command:
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
You can start the Jenkins service with the command
sudo systemctl start jenkins
You can check the status of the Jenkins service using the command:
sudo systemctl status jenkins
If everything has been set up correctly, you should see output similar to this:
Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
Active: active (running) since Tue 2018-11-13 16:19:01 +03; 4min 57s ago

==========================================================================
Uninstall Jenkins

1️⃣ Remove Jenkins package (if installed)
sudo apt remove --purge jenkins -y

This removes:
Jenkins


Config files


(Optional cleanup)
sudo apt autoremove -y


2️⃣ Remove Jenkins APT repository
Delete the repo file you added:
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list


3️⃣ Remove Jenkins signing key
Delete the keyring file:
sudo rm /etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc

#(If the directory is now empty and you want it gone)
#sudo rmdir /etc/apt/keyrings 2>/dev/null


4️⃣ Update APT cache
sudo apt update

This refreshes package lists without Jenkins.

5️⃣ (Optional) Remove Jenkins user & data completely
⚠️ Only do this if you don’t need Jenkins data.
sudo deluser jenkins
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins
sudo rm -rf /var/log/jenkins
sudo rm -rf /etc/default/jenkins


6️⃣ Verify Jenkins is fully removed
which jenkins
systemctl status jenkins
apt policy jenkins
=======================================================================
Uninstall java


1️⃣ Remove OpenJDK 21 and fontconfig
sudo apt remove --purge openjdk-21-jre fontconfig -y


2️⃣ Remove leftover dependencies
sudo apt autoremove -y


3️⃣ Verify Java is removed
java -version
========================================================================
Claude
To reverse what these commands did:
bash
# Remove the installed packages
sudo apt remove openjdk-21-jre fontconfig

# Optional: Also remove dependencies that are no longer needed
sudo apt autoremove

# Verify Java is removed
java -version
What this does:
apt remove uninstalls the packages you installed
apt autoremove cleans up any dependencies that were installed alongside them but are no longer needed
The final java -version should show an error or "command not found" if Java was successfully removed
Note: The apt update command just refreshed your package list - there's nothing to "undo" for that since it didn't install anything.
If you want to be more thorough and remove configuration files too, you can use:
bash
sudo apt purge openjdk-21-jre fontconfig
sudo apt autoremove
The difference is that purge removes both the package and its configuration files, while remove only removes the package itself.
