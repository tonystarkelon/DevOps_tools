Uninstall Jenkins

1️⃣ Remove Jenkins package (if installed)
sudo apt remove --purge jenkins -y

This removes:
Jenkins
Config files
(Optional cleanup)

sudo apt autoremove -y

2️⃣ Remove Jenkins APT repository
Delete the repo file you added:

sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list

3️⃣ Remove Jenkins signing key
Delete the keyring file:

sudo rm /etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc

#(If the directory is now empty and you want it gone)
#sudo rmdir /etc/apt/keyrings 2>/dev/null
4️⃣ Update APT cache
sudo apt update

This refreshes package lists without Jenkins.

5️⃣ (Optional) Remove Jenkins user & data completely
⚠️ Only do this if you don’t need Jenkins data.
sudo deluser jenkins
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins
sudo rm -rf /var/log/jenkins
sudo rm -rf /etc/default/jenkins


6️⃣ Verify Jenkins is fully removed
which jenkins
systemctl status jenkins
apt policy jenkins
=======================================================================
Uninstall java


1️⃣ Remove OpenJDK 21 and fontconfig
sudo apt remove --purge openjdk-21-jre fontconfig -y


2️⃣ Remove leftover dependencies
sudo apt autoremove -y


3️⃣ Verify Java is removed
java -version
========================================================================

To reverse what these commands did:
bash
# Remove the installed packages
sudo apt remove openjdk-21-jre fontconfig

# Optional: Also remove dependencies that are no longer needed
sudo apt autoremove

# Verify Java is removed
java -version
What this does:
apt remove uninstalls the packages you installed
apt autoremove cleans up any dependencies that were installed alongside them but are no longer needed
The final java -version should show an error or "command not found" if Java was successfully removed
Note: The apt update command just refreshed your package list - there's nothing to "undo" for that since it didn't install anything.
If you want to be more thorough and remove configuration files too, you can use:
bash
sudo apt purge openjdk-21-jre fontconfig
sudo apt autoremove
The difference is that purge removes both the package and its configuration files, while remove only removes the package itself.
